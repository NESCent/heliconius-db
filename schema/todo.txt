===Table Genotype===

We are interested in storing linear arrays of locus-specific DNA
sequence data as genotypic data.  One way would be to make
genotype.description have unlimited length (text?).  Other way is
to use accession to the data in Genbank, i.e. add accession fkey to
genotype table.

===Table Pcrexperiment===

* What is the definition for the table? I.e., what is the conceptual
entity? Documentation says 'initial examination'; why not subsequent
examinations? Why is this not a gtassay_result? How is this entity fundamentally
different from a gtexperiment?

* Expected_length should be calculable based on amplicon?

* test_species_id: should be named test_organism_id, or possibly
differently to better reflect the conceptual model?

* columns intron and outcome_success should rather be cvterm foreign keys?

See change to pcrexperiment.

===Column 'Notes'===
 
This is in tables Individual_Phenotype, Stock_Phenotype, and Biotype_Phenotype.

* What is the column 'notes' for? It may not be needed, and may be
  better served by attribute/value associations.
