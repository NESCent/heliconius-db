===Table Genotype===

We are interested in storing linear arrays of locus-specific DNA
sequence data as genotypic data.  One way would be to make
genotype.description have unlimited length (text?).  Other way is
to use accession to the data in Genbank, i.e. add accession fkey to
genotype table.

===Column 'Notes'===
 
This is in tables Individual_Phenotype, Stock_Phenotype, and Biotype_Phenotype.

* What is the column 'notes' for? It may not be needed, and may be
  better served by attribute/value associations.
