==Open Issues==

===Table Pedigree===

* Split out pedigree.{date_mated,date_female_died,days_mated} into pedigree_cvterm?
* Same thing with specimen.{barcode,...}?

===Table Genotype===

We are interested in storing linear arrays of locus-specific DNA
sequence data as genotypic data.  One way would be to make
genotype.description have unlimited length (text?).  Other way is
to use accession to the data in Genbank, i.e. add accession fkey to
genotype table.

===Table Stock===

* Columns maternal_source_id and paternal_source_id should be better named maternal_biotype_id and paternal_biotype_id for consistency?

===Table Biotype===

This relation only has a primary key and no natural attributes. What is its purpose?

===Table Biotype_Organism===

Seems to serve as an association table between Biotype and
Organism. Why would one associate multiple organisms (taxonomic units)
with a single biotype?
 
===Table Geographic_Site===

* county, province, and country seem to be denormalized, and possibly
belong into a controlled vocabulary

===Table Experimenter===

This should be rather represented by module contact, table contact?

===Table Individual===

* Columns 'male' and 'wild' aren't named as obviously boolean
attributes; in fact shouldn't they rather be cvterm references?

* Column 'notes' does not sound like a desirable idea. What is to be noted here?

===Table Cross_Type===

This looks like it is a controlled vocabulary, and hence should be
merged into tables cv and cvterm.

===Table Pedigree===

There are a number of commented out columns. Are they needed or not?

===Table Polytype===

This looks like it is a controlled vocabulary, and hence should be
merged into tables cv and cvterm.

===Table Primer===

This should be represented by module sequence, table feature.

===Table Primer_Designcluster===

Column naming is inconsistent (design_species_id should be
design_organism_id, outgroup_id should be outgroup_organism_id,
designcluster_id should be feature_id, pos should be unambiguous).

===Table gtassay===

Inconsistent column naming (locus_id should be feature_id, or locus_feature_id).

This could possibly be represented also be a primer feature pair and a
super-feature giving the amplicon.

===Table Specimen===

Column storage_location looks like a cvterm foreign key candidate.

===Table Gtexperiment===

Column genotype_published_id should be better named (e.g., simply pub_id).

===Table Studyx===

* Why name the table StudyX? What is this table for?

* This looks rather like a controlled vocabulary, to be folded into
the cv and cvterm tables.

===Table Image===

This may be representable as a dbxref (table dbxref, module general).

===Table Gtassay_test===

* What is the definition for the table? I.e., what is the conceptual
entity? Documentation says 'initial examination'; why not subsequent
examinations? Why is this not a gtassay_result? How is this entity fundamentally
different from a gtexperiment?

* Expected_length should be calculable based on amplicon?

* test_species_id: should be named test_organism_id, or possibly
differently to better reflect the conceptual model?

* columns intron and outcome_success should rather be cvterm foreign keys?

===Table Ptassay===

* This looks rather like a controlled vocabulary?

* Documentation says 'polymorphism detection'; however, is this rather a 
phenotype assay?

===Table individual_phenotype===

* Phenotype_published_id should be just pub_id

* What is column 'notes' for?

===Table Stock_Phenotype===

* Phenotype_published_id should be just pub_id

* What is column 'notes' for?

===Table Biotype_Phenotype===

* Phenotype_published_id should be just pub_id

* What is column 'notes' for?
